# WSL Setup
I use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for web development. It can be a chore to install the same applications whenever I set up a new Linux environment, so these scripts are meant to alleviate that work.

## Requirements
These scripts are meant to be run with the [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q) and the [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVKQC78PK6) apps in the Windows Store on a Windows 10 PC.

## Use
1. Install one of the above Linux apps.

1. Download these scripts to your home directory, which is either:

    1. **~/**
    1. **/home/$USER**

1. Run the command:

    `./00_setup_wsl.sh`

1. Follow the prompts.
